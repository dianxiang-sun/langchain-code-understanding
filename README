Code Understanding Assistant
Description
This project implements a code understanding assistant that can answer questions about a codebase. It clones a Git repository, loads the Python files, splits them into smaller documents, indexes them in a vector store, and creates a question answering pipeline with a retriever and transformer model.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
Git
An OpenAI API key
Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt



Set your OpenAI API key:

export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>



Usage
Run python cu.py and enter a Git repo URL when prompted.

The assistant will clone the repo, load and process the documents, and start an interactive QA loop. Ask questions about the code and it will try to answer based on the docstrings and comments extracted.

Code Overview
clone_repo clones a Git repo from a URL to a local path
load_repo loads Python files from the cloned repo path
split_documents splits files into smaller chunks
create_db_and_retriever indexes the chunks in a vector store
create_qa_chain initializes the QA pipeline with a retriever and transformer
